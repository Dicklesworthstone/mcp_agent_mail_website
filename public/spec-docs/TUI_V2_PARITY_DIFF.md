# TUI v2 Parity + Differentiation Matrix (Legacy mail-web vs Rust v1 vs FrankentUI)

**Bead:** br-3vwi.1.2  
**Date:** 2026-02-10  
**Status:** Draft (in progress)

## Scope

This document is a capability matrix and decision log comparing:

- **Legacy mail-web**: the Python `/mail/*` web UI and related APIs
- **Current Rust surfaces (v1)**: existing Rust web UI and 8-screen TUI
- **FrankentUI showcase**: widget/pattern opportunities for a “showcase-grade” operator console

It is intentionally not an exhaustive parity contract. The exhaustive web parity
matrix/conformance contract is owned by `br-3vwi.13.1`.

## Sources (Concrete)

- Legacy Python routes/tests: `legacy_python_mcp_agent_mail_code/mcp_agent_mail/src/mcp_agent_mail/http.py`,
  `legacy_python_mcp_agent_mail_code/mcp_agent_mail/tests/test_mail_viewer_e2e.py`
- Current Rust web UI routes: `crates/mcp-agent-mail-server/src/mail_ui.rs`
- Current Rust TUI screen registry: `crates/mcp-agent-mail-server/src/tui_screens/mod.rs`
- V2 contract/IA: `docs/TUI_V2_CONTRACT.md`

## Legend

- **Yes**: implemented and operator-usable
- **Partial**: present but missing key behaviors (filtering, pagination, actions, safety)
- **No**: not implemented
- **V2**: explicitly targeted by the V2 contract

## Capability Matrix

| Web “projects siblings” ops (`POST /mail/api/projects/.../siblings/...`) | Yes | No | No | N/A | Likely intentional delta unless needed for ops | TBD (create bead if needed) |
| TUI Dashboard (stats + live stream) | No | Partial (web index/unified inbox) | Yes | Dense stat grid + alert badges | Differentiate: TUI-first operations console | br-3vwi.6.5, br-3vwi.7 |
| TUI Tool Metrics | No | No | Yes | Percentiles + histograms + heatmaps | Differentiate: stronger than web | br-3vwi.7.5 |

## Legacy Mail-Web Route Inventory (Non-Exhaustive)

These routes exist in legacy Python and are either missing or intentionally
different in Rust today. This is a checklist to ensure `br-3vwi.13.*` captures
the full surface area.

- `GET /mail` (legacy: unified inbox HTML)
- `GET /mail/api/unified-inbox` (JSON feed)
- `GET /mail/projects` (projects listing; includes sibling suggestions)
- `POST /mail/api/projects/{project_id}/siblings/{other_id}` (confirm/dismiss/reset suggestions)
- `POST /mail/{project}/inbox/{agent}/mark-read` (single/batch mark read)
- `POST /mail/{project}/inbox/{agent}/mark-all-read`
- `POST /mail/{project}/overseer/send`
- `GET /mail/archive/*` (guide/activity/commit/timeline/browser/network/time-travel/snapshot)

## Notable Legacy Search UX Features

Legacy `/mail/{project}` search supports additional query semantics beyond “q in
subject/body”, including:

- `scope` (subject/body/all)
- `order` (relevance/time)
- `boost` (relevance weight tweak)
- Snippet extraction with `<mark>` highlights when FTS is available

If Rust intentionally omits any of these, record as an explicit delta in the
web parity contract and ensure the operator can still accomplish the core
journeys.

## Recommendations (Immediate)

1. Treat `docs/TUI_V2_CONTRACT.md` as the single product contract source; this matrix should link into it and feed `br-3vwi.13.1`.
2. Close the biggest user-visible gaps first:
   - unified inbox semantics (`/mail` vs `/mail/unified-inbox`)
   - web “mark read” actions
   - overseer send endpoint
   - archive/time-travel story (explicitly fold into export/static pipeline or restore web UI)

## Unresolved Tradeoffs (Record Explicitly)

- **`/mail` meaning**: legacy uses `/mail` for unified inbox; Rust currently uses `/mail` as project index.
  - Option A (parity): make `/mail` unified inbox and move index to `/mail/projects` (legacy-compatible).
  - Option B (delta): keep Rust `/mail` as index, but ensure `/mail/unified-inbox` is first-class and discoverable.
- **Archive/time-travel UI**: legacy has `/mail/archive/*` browsing/network/time-travel routes.
  - Option A (web parity): re-implement archive viewer routes and tests in Rust web UI.
  - Option B (differentiation): fold archive/time-travel into `Exports` + static export workflows, with deep-link/anchor parity.
- **Search “power user” semantics**: legacy supports query scoping, ordering, boost, and FTS snippets.
  - If omitted in Rust, compensate with a clear Search Cockpit UX that still satisfies operator journeys.

## Quality Checks

- Every “Close parity” row must have an owner bead ID before implementation starts.
- When a row is implemented, link evidence (tests/fixtures/E2E script) in the owner bead.
- If a parity row is intentionally skipped, document the delta in `docs/TUI_V2_CONTRACT.md` (or the web parity contract).
